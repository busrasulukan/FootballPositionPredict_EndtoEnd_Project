<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
📝 The scope of this project is to build a machine learning model to predict the new positions of soccer players based on the changes in their performance over time.After building a machine learning model, we have created a FastAPI model deployment and a web-site which includes information and model interface for our FastAPI model.

📝 This GitHub repository contains end-to-end process of our FastAPI Model Deployment .

🌐 The interface created for FastAPI after the decided model is as follows, you can click on the image to access model interface.

🔍 Player data from the Fifa 24 site was obtained through the selenium library using web scraping methods. The obtained data was stored in Google Cloud Big Query and then imported to jupyternotebook. After the necessary pre-processing on the data, visualization analysis was performed with PowerBi. After deciding on the most appropriate method as a result of the work done in Jupyter Notebooks, the FastApi deployment of the model was realized and deployed to Google Cloud for the application url. <a href="https://github.com/busrasulukan/A-Multi-Classification-Model-Football-Position-Predict">More About: View this project's Model Predictions and Reports</a>
